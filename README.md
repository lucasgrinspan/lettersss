## A very specific use case

Has this happened to you?
* You have to transcribe a large amount of data by hand
* That data is available in a CSV
* That data needs to get formatted as an envelope address
* You need dark mode

If so, then you landed on the right spot!

In seriousness, this is a small utility created for [Alachua Conservation Trust](https://alachuaconservationtrust.org) (donate!) that parses a CSV file of names and addresses, presenting the data in envelope format in a **really big** font size. The file that gets uploaded doesn't go to any servers. I don't even have a server.

## Usage

You can just visit the GitHub pages of this repo to access the utility: https://lucasgrinspan.github.io/lettersss/index.html. Or you can clone the repo and open `index.html` in your browser.

After uploading a CSV, the site will parse the file, presenting each line one at a time. Press the space bar or the right arrow key to move to the next entry. Press the left arrow key to move back an entry.
